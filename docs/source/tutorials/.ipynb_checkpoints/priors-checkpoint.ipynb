    "full distribution we are considering about an event like an earthquake\n",
    "or explosion. This vector is 4D corresponding to latitude, longitude,\n",
    "depth, and event magnitude.\n",

    "are called `theta_data`. For computing EIG, the prior distribution over\n",
    "data generating events should be the prior distribution over event\n",
    "hypothesis. However, for some applications it may make sense to bias\n",
    "this distribution, meaning that you care more about EIG about a certain\n",
    "type of events. For example, you may only care about EIG for events less\n",
    "than magnitude 2 or events within 1km of the surface. This information\n",
    "could be used to bias the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sample_theta_space` function returns a set of events distributed\n",
    "according to importance distribution, which will then be used to\n",

    "Bayesian inference. These events will be used to define the space of\n",

    "In the code this is the variable `theta_space`. These finite number of\n",
